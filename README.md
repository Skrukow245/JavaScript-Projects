<h1> Pizza Menu</h1>
<br>
<p> This is a menu that allows you to choose a pizza size of your preference with a mix of toppings. It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order. </p>
<h1> Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h1>
<br>
<p>The classic game of tic-tac-toe. You play against a computer and the winner is celebrated with a victory noise. The board is reset after a tie or win, and a new game is ready to be played. </p>
